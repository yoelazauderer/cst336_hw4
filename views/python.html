                   <p>Released in 1991, Python was developed by Guido van Possum. <br>A high level object-oriented programming language, 
                   Python is many programmers first choice in languages. Pythonâ€™s syntax is very simple and readable, as well as 
                   succinct, providing for concise code. <br>One major advantage of Python is that it can execute immediately upon being 
                   written, which makes debugging a lot faster. <br><br>Python 2, as well as the newer version Python 3, both remain very popular. <br><br>One 
                   interesting thing to note about Python is its use of a new line to separate commands, as opposed to many other 
                   languages which a require a semicolon or some other character to complete a statement. </p>
